# IJC445-DataVisualisation
This projects explores how selected audio features relate to mainstream chart success using the Billboard Hot 100 data set from 2000-2023.
The analysis focuses on instrumentalness, loudness, and song duration, examining how these features are distributed and how they relate to each other.
Key findings show instrumentalness is heavily concentrated near zero, while loudness and duration display relatively stable patterns across charting songs.
To show these visualisation were made and explored.
This repository contains the R code and final visualisations used in the IJC445 Data Visualisation coursework, having comments to guide through the steps taken.
